# Linear search
In computer science, a linear search or sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.

Linear search runs in at worst linear time and makes at most `n `comparisons, where `n` is the length of the list.

## Complexity
Worst-case performance:	`O(n)`  
Best-case performance	`O(1)`  
Average performance	`O(n/2)`
